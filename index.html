          One reason people lie is to achieve personal power. Achieving personal power is helpful for someone who pretends
          to be more confident than he really is. For example, one of my friends threw a party at his house last month.
          He asked me to come to his party and bring a date. However, I didn’t have a girlfriend. One of my other friends,
          who had a date to go to the party with, asked me about my date.

          <h3 class="main-content__main-article__quote">
            That is AMAZING
          </h3>

          <p class="main-content__main-article">

            I didn’t want to be embarrassed, so I claimed
            that I had a lot of work to do. I said I could easily find a date even better than his if I wanted to. I also
            told him that his date was ugly. I achieved power to help me feel confident; however, I embarrassed my friend
            and his date. Although this lie helped me at the time, since then it has made me look down on myself. Plus,
            some more sample text just to fill out the article a little more. I don't think you can really add too many
            words, especially if you want to get a better idea how it's all gonna look together. Lorem text is annoying.
            I don't like that so much text is generated. Well, I guess you can have to much text for an example.
