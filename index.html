            Surfing has given me many unforgettable years of fun, health and recreation.
            After teaching beginning surfers for more than 20 years, I've seen the long
            list of obstacles that they have to overcome in order to learn. To put it
            bluntly, surfing literally takes years to master. But with the help of this
            instruction, you should be able to avoid many of the common mistakes that students make.

            It always helps to start when you're young, but age isn't nearly as important as physical conditioning.
             The best cross-training for surfing is swimming. As you'll quickly discover, at least 95 percent of your
            surfing time will be spent paddling rather than riding waves. To make this a bearable experience, you must
            have a strong upper body. A pool will work, but the optimum option is open-ocean swimming. It will help
            your conditioning and confidence in all types of ocean conditions. Sooner or later, your leash is going
             to break, and when it does, you'll be infinitely safer if you know what to do. I'd recommend a workout
             regimen of three days a week with a mixture of long-distance and sprint swims. Also, I recommend taking
              a course in CPR before you start spending extended periods of time in the water. The ocean is
             unpredictable-always be prepared for the worst.

            Before paddling out, always assess the conditions and know your limits.
            Unlike other sports, your playing field is constantly changing. Two-foot
            mushburgers one day can be 10-foot meat grinders the next. Obviously, the most important
            element of this changing playing field is the waves. Waves are created by wind and storms out at sea.
            How these waves hit your local break are determined by a number of factors: bottom contour, tides and
            wind. Waves break over the following bottom contours:
